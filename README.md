## Installation

pip install notebook

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

jupyter notebook

## Project motivation

To be able to predict the price, weekly-price, and monthly-price of an airbnb based on data about the home.

## Summary of results

### We found the following

#### Price
- The most important factor for price was the host acceptance rate
#### Weekly-price
- The most important factor for price was the host acceptance rate
#### Monthly-price
- The most important factor for price was the number of people the home accomodates

## Files Description

### Business Understanding

We would like to know what factors about a home will affect the price of an airbnb and how these factors are different when predicing the price, weekly price, and monthly price of said home.

1) What factors are important when predicting the price

2) What factors are important when predicting the weekly-price

3) What factors are important when predicting the monthly-price

### Data Understanding

Upon reviewing the data we found a few things that stuck out..

1) Percentages were provided as strings with percentage signs and monetary values were provided as formatted strings e.g. 90%, $10,000; these needed to be converted to numbers.
2) There were lots of fields that we found to be useless such as many urls, the presence of a url could be useful however we believed that this is covered by the host verifications field.
3) Other fields such as summart/notes were just descriptions that we decided to drop instead of getting into analyzing whether that is a positive or negative description.

### Prepare Data

1) For each test price, weekly-price, monthly-price we droped any entries with na values for the test variable.
2) Drop the list of values that were found to not be helpful to the prediction (this was done with trial and error for some fields such as space which surprisingly was not helpful for the prediction). 

### Evaluation and Findings

1) Price - 
We can see here that the most important factor for price of a rental is the host acceptance rate, we can also see that having many reviews will impact the price (either for better or for worse)

2) Weekly-price -
We can see here that the most important factor is still the host acceptance rate. But now some new factors come into play; the host verifications, the property type (apparently people wont pay as much for a week in a shared room or private room in someones house, and also the number of bedrooms and bathrooms come into play).

3) Monthly-price -
We have some new info when looking predicting the monthly price we can see the most important factor is number of people that the rental accomodates (I guess people donâ€™t like to vacation alone after all). For this prediction the review scores for different types of reviews (location, communication, etc.) start to come into play.
